README for libfirewall
======================

libfirewall provides a gobject introspection interface for firewalld. It is an
alternative to firewall.client provided by firewalld.

The library is in alpha state and provides methods and structures to query
existing configuration and to mdify it. But there is no support for the D-Bus
signals that firewalld sends out, yet.


Development
-----------
To check out the source repository, you can use:

  git clone https://github.com/firewalld/libfirewall.git

This will create a local copy of the repository.


Working With The Source Repository
----------------------------------
You can use the source repository directly to test out changes. Change into the 
firewalld base directory and set the following environment variables.

  export LIBFIREWALL_DEVEL_ENV=$(pwd)/src
  export GI_TYPELIB_PATH=$LIBFIREWALL_DEVEL_ENV
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBFIREWALL_DEVEL_ENV/.libs


Install the following requirements or packages:

  glib2-devel
  gobject-introspection-devel


Use

  make

to create the libraryies, the tests and also the programs in contrib.

Now you are done.
